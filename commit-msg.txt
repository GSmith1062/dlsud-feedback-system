Note:
- put commits in commit-msg.text for multi-line messages, tho pwede rin normal commit message lang
- may use "git commit -F commit-msg.txt" in terminal

known issues:
- inbox feedback title overflow for stu-feedback-log.html
	- lengthy feedback titles lead to expanding of grid
	- used band aid solution for now
- inbox right-most text header overflow for stu-feedback-log.html
- used dark background instead of image used in figma for feedback-form.html
	- background image is provided in pics folder
- pt sans caption does not work

Could improve
- preview of what feedback is being updated for the admin side
- header navigation. Could change depending on what page is currently on

To do:
- hover indicators
- feedback log for admin and student
	- inbox
	- preview
